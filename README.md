# Mobile Banking App (Flutter)

This is a **simple mobile banking application** developed using **Flutter**. The app allows users to:
- View a **welcome screen** with a bank logo and today's date.
- See a **list of bank accounts** with details (type, number, and balance).
- View **transaction details** for a selected account.
- **Navigate** between screens easily.

## 📌 How Does It Work?
1. **Welcome Screen**  
   - Displays the **bank logo**, **welcome message**, and **today’s date**.
   - Has a **"View Accounts"** button to navigate to the **Accounts List**.

2. **Accounts List Screen**  
   - Lists all user accounts (**Chequing & Savings**).
   - Shows **account type, account number, and balance**.
   - Each account has a **"View Transactions"** button.

3. **Transactions Screen**  
   - Displays **transaction history** for the selected account.
   - Shows **date, description, and amount** of transactions.
   - Negative amounts are in **red** (expenses), positive amounts are in **green** (income).
   - Has a **"Back" button** to return to the **Accounts List**.

## 📌 Key Files
### 1️⃣ **`lib/main.dart`** (Modified)
- **Handles the entire app logic** (navigation, UI, JSON data).
- **Added comments** to explain Flutter widgets & logic.

### 2️⃣ **`assets/json_data.json`** (New - If using an external JSON file)
- Contains account and transaction data.
- Currently, data is hardcoded inside `main.dart`.

## 📌 Where Did the Original Source Come From?
- **This project was built from scratch** as a basic Flutter app.
- The **JSON structure was provided by the user** (modified to fit Flutter).
- **Modified to properly link accounts with transactions**.

## 📌 Modifications & Why?
- **Changed Transactions Data Structure**:  
  - Initially, transactions were linked to account **numbers**.
  - Updated them to link with account **types** (Chequing, Savings).
  
- **Added Comments** to Explain Code:  
  - Now every major function is documented in **`main.dart`**.

- **Improved UI & Navigation**:  
  - Better button styling, **clearer labels**, and **account balance formatting**.

## 📌 How to Run the App
